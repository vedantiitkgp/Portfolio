Hello! I'm Vedant Saraswat, from Singrauli, knowngit  as India's Power Capital. My journey in technology began in this peaceful city, shaping my aspirations and outlook.

I pride myself on being creative, punctual, and dedicated, with a strong moral compass. These qualities, combined with my high energy, strong communication skills, and meticulous attention to detail, have been key to my academic and professional achievements.
My academic journey led me to the prestigious [Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kharagpur](https://www.iitkgp.ac.in/), where I pursued a Bachelor's in Manufacturing Science and Engineering with a minor in Computer Science from 2017 to 2021. I graduated at the top of my class and was honored with the RK Bramha Cup for Best Final Year Student in Technology, receiving a commendation letter from the Institute's Director.

During my time at IIT, I immersed myself in advanced computer science coursework and participated actively in the tech community. I was part of numerous award-winning hackathons, tech competitions, and math olympiads. My leadership skills flourished as I took on roles coordinating for the [Technology Transfer Group](https://wiki.metakgp.org/w/Technology_Transfer_Group) and [TEDx IIT Kharagpur](http://tedxiitkharagpur.com/).

To gain hands-on experience, I completed internships at leading tech companies. At [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/), I worked in software development with the Transportation Tech team, gaining insight into complex logistics systems. At [Tech Mahindra](https://www.techmahindra.com/), I was part of the IBUTUS Team, focusing on data science projects. My internship at [AgNext](https://agnext.com/) was particularly impactful - I helped release a product for the Agricultural Spice Board of India, applying deep learning and computer vision techniques. I also spent time at the University of Bari Aldo Moro in Italy, broadening my international perspective on tech research.

After graduation, I joined [MX Player](https://www.mxplayer.in/) in Mumbai as a software engineer. For two years, I contributed to building streamlined video streaming experiences for over 175 million monthly active users. My role encompassed full-stack architecture, from crafting frontend interfaces to designing robust backend APIs and systems. I also implemented machine learning algorithms and focused on optimizing web performance.

Currently, I'm pursuing an MS in Computer Science at the [University of California, Irvine](https://uci.edu/), specializing in Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing. I'm funded through Graduate Teaching Assistantships, educating fellow students on Big Data Management concepts including Spark, SQL/NoSQL Databases, and Transaction Management. Also working with university as [ELP Data and Technology Fellow](https://odit.uci.edu/initiatives/elp.php) at UC Irvine, I'm developing Explainable AI applications for UCI Health. My projects include creating modular RAG-based clinical trial matching platforms and sustainability analytics dashboards. I'm also volunteering with the ZotBins team, working on efficient image processing architecture for smart waste bins.

I'm expanding my practical experience through a Machine Learning internship at [Viasat](https://www.viasat.com/), where I'm building a predictive pipeline for active residential and in-flight network bandwidth estimation. Simultaneously, I'm contributing to research with Dr. Dan Roth's [Cognitive Computation Group](https://cogcomp.seas.upenn.edu/page/people/) at the University of Pennsylvania, focusing on Tabular Natural Language Inference under Dr. Vivek Gupta's guidance.

My diverse experiences across academia, industry, and research have equipped me with a unique perspective on tackling complex technological challenges. I'm passionate about leveraging my skills in artificial intelligence and machine learning to drive innovation and create meaningful impact in the field of computer science.

That's who I am - Vedant Saraswat: a computer scientist, mechanical innovator, and lifelong learner, always ready to push the boundaries of technology and make a lasting contribution to the field.

Here are a few of the other activities that I love to do!
