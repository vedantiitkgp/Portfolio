 Implemented [UCI Search Engine](https://github.com/vedantiitkgp/SearchEngine-InfoRetreival) using PageRank for relevance, n-gram indexing, enhanced inverted index with word positioning, and integrated large language models for semantic understanding, resulting in 40% improvement in top 5 search results; utilized user feedback for continuous refinement using RLHF techniques and Proximal Policy Optimization.
