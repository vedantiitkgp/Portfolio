- Worked with [IBUTUS team]() on project titled "VOIP workflow error predicition".
- Visualized 100 advanced features from 3 lakh+ instances using pandas extracted from their cloud server.
- Correcting the [Label Imbalance problem](): Implemented both label and label-powerset specific over- sampling and under-sampling algorithms that decreased the value of the IRlbl and CVIR per label.
- Used Cost-sensitive learning methods to improve Label Concurrence issues, achieving a [ 15% decrease in SCUMBLE]() value per instance.
- Incorporated ML-ENN, REMEDIAL, and ML-SMOTE algorithms contributing on the multi-label implementation of the [Imbalanced-learn]() library.
- Contrasted different Keras and Sk-multi learn models improving precision and recall of neural networks by 35% using Ensemble and Data Enrichment Techniques
